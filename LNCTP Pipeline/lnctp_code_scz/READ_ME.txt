LNCTP code for SCZ models. Full model with cell-to-cell network

To run pre-trained models, call:

python lnctp_train_models.py

To train new models, call:

python lnctp_test_models.py

NB Models use pre-calculated imputed cell-type expression data (in ./data) and pre-trained models (in ./models_saved)

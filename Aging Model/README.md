# Aging model
We constructed a model that uses cell type gene expression to predict the age of samples. We account for the fact that individual variability might manifest in the number and types of cells present. Recognizing that certain cell types might only be prevalent in a subset of individuals, our initial step involves filtering out cell types that are present in less than 70% of the population. This QC step results in 11 distinct cell types. We then sought to establish a sample pool wherein all 11 cell types are uniformly present. This resulted in an intersection that incorporated approximately 180 individuals. For our predictive modeling, we used the XGBoost regression framework, crafting a model for each of the identified cell types to predict age across each of our sample pools. Given the importance of age distribution, we applied stratified sampling for our train-test split. Specifically, we grouped ages using a bin width of 10 years, ensuring that both training and test samples were proportionately drawn from each bin. This culminated in an 80-20% train-test division. To gauge the efficacy and precision of our models, we implemented multiple evaluation metrics: Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error. The XGBoost models were trained using three-fold cross-validation, adopting the negative mean squared error as the scoring function. For robustness, this train-test split process was repeated ten times, and we present both the mean and SD of our results. 

To derive deeper insights from our model predictions, we incorporated the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) method. SHAP values, rooted in cooperative game theory, offer a principled framework to interpret and attribute the contributions of individual features to machine learning predictions. In our age prediction, a positive SHAP value for a specific feature indicates its role in driving predictions towards higher ages, while a negative value suggests the opposite. By analyzing these values, one gains a clearer understanding of the factors influencing age predictions, potentially revealing cell-type-specific age expression markers that correlate with the aging processes.
